	 * Creates a digital signature for a specific user action.
	 * This method takes the user's identity, the action they performed, and the security
	 * context (label) of the action, and generates a signed payload.
	 *
	 * @note In its current form, this uses a placeholder `btoa` for the signature.
	 * In a production environment, this **MUST** be replaced with a robust digital signature
	 * standard like JSON Web Signatures (JWS) using a private key managed by a secure service.
	 *
	 * @param {object} params - The parameters for the signing action.
	 * @param {string} params.userId - The unique identifier of the user performing the action.
	 * @param {object} params.action - An object describing the action being performed (e.g., `{ type: 'create', entity: 'event' }`).
	 * @param {object} params.label - The security label of the context in which the action is performed (e.g., `{ classification: 'secret' }`).
	 * @returns {Promise<{signature: string, algorithm: string, timestamp: string}>} A promise that resolves to an object containing the signature, the algorithm used (currently a stub), and an ISO 8601 timestamp.
