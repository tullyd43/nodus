# Productivity App - IndexedDB Foundation

This is your complete IndexedDB foundation for the productivity app, built with vanilla JavaScript and MVVM architecture.

## 🚀 What You Have

### ✅ Complete Database Schema
- **All 15 tables** from your PostgreSQL design implemented in IndexedDB
- **Polymorphic relationships** for tags and links working correctly
- **Automatic indexing** for fast queries
- **Audit logging** system built-in

### ✅ MVVM Architecture
- **Models**: Event, Item, Tag with full CRUD operations
- **ViewModel**: MainViewModel with reactive state management
- **View**: Basic test interface to verify everything works

### ✅ Core Features Working
- **Quick Capture**: Type thoughts and press Enter
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically extracts hashtags and due dates
- **Universal Tagging**: Same tags work across Events and Items
- **Event Management**: Create, update, delete with full relationships

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Open in browser**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:3000

2. **Test the foundation**:
   - Type something in "Quick Capture" and press Enter
   - Try adding hashtags: "Buy milk #shopping #urgent"
   - Click "Add Test Event" to create sample data
   - Click "Query Events" to see everything working

## 🧪 Testing Your Database

The test interface lets you verify that:
- ✅ Events are created with proper relationships
- ✅ Tags are extracted and linked correctly
- ✅ Queries return data with all relationships intact
- ✅ IndexedDB indexes are working for fast search

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/
├── index.html              # Main page with test interface
├── package.json            # Dependencies (just Dexie + serve)
├── css/
│   └── main.css           # Basic styling
└── js/
    ├── database/
    │   ├── schema.js      # Complete IndexedDB schema
    │   └── db.js          # Database connection & initialization
    ├── models/
    │   ├── event.js       # Event model (Verbs)
    │   ├── item.js        # Item model (Nouns)
    │   └── tag.js         # Tag model (Universal tagging)
    ├── viewmodels/
    │   └── main-vm.js     # Main ViewModel (MVVM pattern)
    └── app.js             # Application entry point
```

## 🎯 What's Next

Now that your data foundation is solid, you can:

1. **Build Real UI**: Replace the test interface with your actual views
2. **Add More Features**: Collections, routines, goals, etc.
3. **Enhance Search**: Full-text search, advanced filtering
4. **Add Views**: List, Timeline, Kanban, Cards views
5. **Polish UX**: Better forms, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts

## 🔍 Key Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Event/Item Dichotomy**: Clean separation of "verbs" vs "nouns"
- **Polymorphic Tags**: One tag system for everything
- **Flat Network**: No folders, just tags and links
- **Schema-Driven**: Event Types and Item Types define structure

### Code Architecture  
- **Pure MVVM**: Models have no UI code, ViewModels manage state
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Just Dexie for IndexedDB abstraction
- **Vanilla JS**: No framework lock-in, maximum control
- **Observable State**: ViewModel notifies UI of changes

### Performance Features
- **Smart Indexing**: Compound indexes for common query patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Related data loaded only when needed
- **Efficient Queries**: Leverages IndexedDB's native capabilities

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
npm start     # Start development server
npm run dev   # Start with live reload
```

## 💡 Smart Capture Examples

Try these in the Quick Capture box:

```
Buy groceries #shopping #errands
Call dentist due 10/15/2024 #health
Project meeting notes #work #important
```

The system automatically:
- Extracts hashtags as tags
- Parses due dates
- Creates proper Event objects
- Links everything through the database

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2

Your IndexedDB foundation is complete! You now have:
- ✅ All your database tables working
- ✅ Complex relationships functioning
- ✅ MVVM patterns established  
- ✅ Smart capture working
- ✅ Test interface to verify everything

Time to build your real UI on top of this solid foundation!
